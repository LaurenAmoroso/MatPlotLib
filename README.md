I have attached my work for this weeks challenge. In this, it looks like Capomulin has the lowest final tumoor volume, this may be adjusted with more information on the outliers for Infubinol. Within the treatment time frame of Capomulin, there is also a peak at the Tumor volume midway through the treatment cycle. I did find it intersting that the mice with the placebo were the second highest for tumor volume.
